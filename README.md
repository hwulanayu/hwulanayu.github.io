# Data Science Projects
My data science projects collection. Some projects are done to fulfill college assignments, some are just for fun.

## Project List:
### [Exploratory Data Analysis on Abalone Dataset](https://github.com/hwulanayu/hwulanayu.github.io/blob/master/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20on%20Abalone%20Dataset.ipynb)
Analyze the Abalone dataset from [this site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone). The dataset is meant to predict abalone age with its physical measurement. However, we're only trying to do some EDA and test whether the PCA method can be applied to this dataset.

The project was completed as part of Computer Science's 'Data Science' course at Universitas Indonesia.

### [Real or Fake Job Posting Classifier](https://github.com/hwulanayu/hwulanayu.github.io/blob/master/Real%20or%20Fake%20Job%20Postings%20Classification%20(text%20features).ipynb)
Make classifier using Python sklearn library and Keras Neural Network with this dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction). I make two versions with the sklearn library, one which uses only text features dataset and one with text and numerical features combined. The dataset is imbalanced, so I used f1-score metric. It turns out the highest f1-score is almost the same, which is 0.92.
* [Real or Fake Job Posting Classifier with KNN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression (text features)](https://github.com/hwulanayu/hwulanayu.github.io/blob/master/Real%20or%20Fake%20Job%20Postings%20Classification%20(text%20features).ipynb)
* [Real or Fake Job Posting Classifier with KNN and Logistic Regression (combined text and numerical features)](https://github.com/hwulanayu/hwulanayu.github.io/blob/master/Real%20or%20Fake%20Job%20Postings%20Classification%20(text%2Bnumeric%20features).ipynb)
* Real or Fake Job Posting Classifier with Keras (to be updated)

The project(the sklearn one) was completed as part of Computer Science's 'Data Science' course at Universitas Indonesia.

### Clustering
Clustering seeds type from this [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds) with K-means and Hierarchical Clustering. The dataset has a label, so we use it to calculate the accuracy model. The accuracy value of K-means modeling is 0.92, while the hierarchical accuracy value is 0.89.
* [Clustering Wheat Seeds with K-means Clustering](https://github.com/hwulanayu/hwulanayu.github.io/blob/master/Clustering%20Wheat%20Seeds%20with%20K-means%20Clustering.ipynb)
* [Clustering Wheat Seeds with Hierarchical Clustering](https://github.com/hwulanayu/hwulanayu.github.io/blob/master/Clustering%20Wheat%20Seeds%20with%20Hierarchical%20Clustering.ipynb)

The project was completed as part of Computer Science's 'Data Science' course at Universitas Indonesia.

### [Web Scraping](https://github.com/hwulanayu/web-scraping-female-daily/blob/master/Scraping%20Female%20Daily%20August%202021.ipynb)
Scraping local skincare products, reviews, and user demographics (anonymized user names) on the [Female Daily website](https://femaledaily.com/) and transforming the dataset using Selenium, Numpy, and Pandas Python library.
